The document details various security measures, including key management, credential management, and secure presentation protocols to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity</li> <li>Supporting Functions: Supporting functions for digital wallets include mechanisms for wallet and device locking/unlocking, user interface/user experience considerations, and holder binding. The document emphasizes the importance of these functions for ensuring security and usability</li> <li>Governance Pillar: Governance involves regulatory compliance, certification, counterparty verification, and audit requirements.

A DIDComm mediator serves as a persistent endpoint for client agents, allowing them to receive messages securely and efficiently, even when direct peer-to-peer communication is not possible. This allows a peer contact, such as an enterprise issuer or verifier, to initiate a messaging exchange with a mobile agent. This is a substantial improvement of the situation today, when enterprises are limited to initiating interactions or sending notifications via untrusted emails and SMSs that are often discarded as phishing attacks.</p>"},{"location":"projects/didcomm-mediator/#key-features","title":"Key Features","text":"<ul> <li>DIDComm Message Relaying: The primary function of the DIDComm Mediator is to relay inbound DIDComm messages to client agents. It enables agents that cannot maintain an addressable endpoint to receive messages through a trusted third-party mediator, ensuring that communication remains uninterrupted. The mediator has no visibility to the embedded message being relayed.</li> <li>Routing and Delivery: The service offers routing capabilities, directing DIDComm messages to the correct recipient even if the recipient\u2019s agent is temporarily offline. It queues messages and delivers them when the recipient becomes available, enhancing reliability in environments with unstable connections.</li> <li>Extensibility and Customization: DIDComm Mediator is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing developers to extend its functionality according to specific use cases. It embeds the deployers' choice of ACA-Py or Credo-TS to handle the DIDComm messaging. That underlying power makes DIDComm Mediator Service adaptable to a wide range of deployment scenarios, from simple message relaying to more complex mediation tasks.</li> <li>Community-Driven Development: DIDComm Mediator Service is developed and maintained by a global community of contributors. This collaborative approach ensures that the service evolves in line with the needs of the broader decentralized identity ecosystem.</li> </ul> <p>The service is particularly useful for agents operating on mobile devices or in environments where maintaining a constant connection is challenging.

Governments around the world deemed them \u2018Essential\u2019 during the recent pandemic. While services and programs exist to help, it\u2019s challenging and costly for organizations that provide them to securely collect and verify the information needed to prove applicant eligibility claims.  As a result, most farmworkers forego services and resources they need, even though they\u2019re eligible for them.  </p> <p>Over the last three years, Entidad and the UFW Foundation have been exploring digital trust technologies to solve this problem. We\u2019ve developed Preparese<sup>TM</sup>, a digital infrastructure solution that lets farmworker organizations securely reuse verified farmworker information, eliminating the need for repetitive collection. The solution layers didcomm, wallet, decentralized identifiers, and verifiable credential technologies with a low-code application development platform, Mendix.  </p> <p>Mendix has been a key component in making the Preparese<sup>TM</sup> solution possible. Low-code software development has been growing in popularity and bringing new audiences to the practice.\u202fMendix, one of the more popular platforms with over 300K active developers and 50M users, has enabled Entidad and the UFW Foundation to develop, launch, and maintain enterprise-grade digital trust enabled solutions that solve real world problems. </p> <p>We\u2019ve built two products, using this technology. For organizations we\u2019ve built Preparese Platform<sup>TM</sup>, it allows them to quickly develop and launch digital trust enabled services and programs. For farmworkers, we\u2019ve developed Preparese Mobile<sup>TM</sup> which combines a verifiable digital profile with a suite of tools that simplify interactions with organizations on the platform. </p> <p>The Preparese Platform<sup>TM</sup> is being used by 9 organizations and has 5 digital services in production. The most recent service launched is being used to process and distribute $80 million in one-time relief payments to over 125,000 workers, under the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s Farm and Food Workers Relief Program (FFWR).  </p> <p>The second product, Preparese Mobile<sup>TM</sup>, is designed around the unique needs of farmworkers. We\u2019ve developed a react native mobile app that lets farmworkers store, manage, and exchange their verified information. Engagement with organizations is made easier with DIDComm-based communication capabilities such as text and video chat.  </p> <p>One of the cornerstone technologies of the solution is an interoperable Mendix enabled digital wallet. The wallet components need to be able to engage with various non-profit, government, and philanthropic sources, each with their own technology stacks. For this reason, interoperability and working with open standard frameworks has been a priority. The project team members have participated in TrustOverIP Foundation, Hyperledger Aries JS Working Group, and various other communities, including DID Communication Working Group and OpenWallet Foundation of late, to ensure we adhere to best practices and standards.       </p> <p>While currently focused on farmworkers, the Mendix digital wallet engine can be used to help others. There are many other underserved communities that could benefit greatly from the privacy, accessibility, and security digital wallets can provide. With this social impact purpose in mind and spirit of further collaboration, Entidad and the UFW Foundation propose to open source the digital wallet engine used in their Preparese<sup>TM</sup> solution. By making these resources available, we hope to facilitate a wide variety of social impact.  </p> <p>Additionally, the project allows us to bridge and advance the interest of both the OpenWallet Foundation and Mendix communities.  By collaborating with the Mendix community, we not only have the ability to grow the number of digital trust technology practitioners, we also tap into a community with an established customer base. By making digital wallets components that can be easily integrated into their existing solutions, the project can drive further adoption and usage of interoperable, secure and privacy preserving digital wallets. </p>"},{"location":"projects/fwos/#origin-history","title":"Origin &amp; History","text":"<p>The origins of the Farmworker Wallet OS project align with those of Entidad.

The solution was used to plan, manage and operate over 500 in-person community events where over $15 million in resources were distributed to over 40K families.
