# Task Forces

A _task force_ is a group that is focused on a task with limited scope and fixed time to complete. Unlike a (special interest group](../SIGs/index.md), a task force will have a specific set of deliverables or work products that it will create and be limited in time to completion. A task force can be created by anyone in the OpenWallet Foundation community and must be proposed to and approved by the TAC.
