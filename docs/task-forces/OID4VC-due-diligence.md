# OID4VC Due Diligence Task Force
Currently, the [OID4VC](https://openid.net/openid4vc/) components for implementing decentralized identities such as [OID4VCI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) and [OID4VP](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html) are gaining traction, especially in Europe. These specifications are required by the European digital identity Architectural Reference Framework but also getting significant attention outside of Europe. 

This task force will investigate the specifications belonging to the OID4VC family thoroughly, check the existing implementations, and start the preliminary work for potentially creating/hosting a reference implementation or a framework that can be used by a wider community for application implementations.

This task force was accepted by the TAC on [May 31, 2023](../meetings/2023/2023-05-31.md). See [OID4VC Due Diligence Task Force Proposal](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/tac/issues/23) for more details.
