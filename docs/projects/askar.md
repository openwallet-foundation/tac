# Askar

## Project Description
Askar is an open-source, secure storage and key management service implemented in Rust (with wrappers for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript), designed to support the needs of decentralized trust systems within and beyond the Aries ecosystem. It is a critical component that securely manages cryptographic keys, credentials, and other sensitive data used in decentralized identity frameworks. Askar is the secure storage/key management solution for Credo-TS, ACA-Py, Identus, Aries VCX, and other decentralized trust projects.

Askar implements a lightweight, efficient, and secure way to store and manage decentralized trust data such as keys, credentials, and DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers). It is designed to work seamlessly with Aries and other decentralized identity agents, ensuring that the data these agents require is stored securely and can be accessed and used as needed. The project focuses on offering robust cryptographic support, including encryption, signing, and key management, all essential for secure decentralized identity operations. Contributors have extended Askar to work with HSM-based keys.

Askar supports various backend storage options from SQLite to Postgres, making it adaptable to different environments and use cases from mobile and IoT to large scale Enterprise deployments. It is designed to be embedded in a wide variety of decentralized trust implementations and includes wrappers for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript (for NodeJS and React Native implementations).

The project is developed and maintained by a community of sophisticated developers that are building Askar into their own digital trust projects and deployments. It contributes to the broader goal of creating secure, scalable, open-source infrastructure for decentralized identity management.
