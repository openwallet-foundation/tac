# 2024 wallet-framework-dotnet (Wallet Framework for .NET)

## Project Health

The Wallet Framework for .NET project provides a robust framework for building identity wallets based on verifiable credentials, written in C#/.NET. It has received consistent updates over the past year and continues to be actively maintained.

## Maintainer Diversity
The project is maintained by five maintainers from three different organizations.
Three people from Lissi GmbH, one from Develappers GmbH and one from esatus AG.

## Project Adoption
The project is primarily used by the Lissi GmbH Organization for its Identity Wallet, the Lissi Wallet.

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals

Over the past year, we have introduced a wide range of features to support the development of identity wallets. These enhancements include implementing the OpenID protocols for issuing and presenting credentials (OID4VCI and OID4VP), as well as ISO protocols for in-person presentations (ISO 18013-5 and ISO 23022-4). Additionally, we have extended the support for multiple credential formats, including SD-JWT and mdoc.

### Next Year's Goals

The project aims to continuously enhance and extend its features while staying up to date with relevant standards and protocols.

## Help Required
No further assistance is needed.

## Project Lifecycle Stage Recommendation
We recommend that the project remains in the Labs stage.
