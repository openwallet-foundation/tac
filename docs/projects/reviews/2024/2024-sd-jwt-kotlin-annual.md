# 2024 sd-jwt-kotlin (SD-JWT Implementation)

## Project Health

The main focus of this project was to provide a Kotlin implementation for the
IETF SD-JWT draft. However, the project remains without any updates for a while and
the maintainer decided to post an announcement stating this project is no longer maintained.
However during TAC meeting for annual review, there was a volunteer stepped up to 
take care of this project.


## Maintainer Diversity

As before, the project is maintained by a single maintainer.
It's expected to have a single maintainer for the next year as well.

## Project Adoption

This project was used by German Bundesdruckerei but not sure they are still using.

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals

The project implemented with success to it's initial goal but not well maintained or used.

### Next Year's Goals

This project aims to have a cloned copy of eudi-reference-wallet-sdjwt to have every language
implementation stays under OWF umbrella.

## Help Required

The project is maintainable with one maintainer and no further aid is needed.
We are planning to automate the process (maybe using github actions).

## Project Lifecycle Stage Recommendation

The project is recommended to remain in the Labs stage.
