# 2024 sd-jwt-dotnet (SD-JWT Implementation)

## Project Health

The main focus of this project was to provide a .Net implementation for the
IETF SD-JWT draft. As such, the code has reflected the developments in the
specification over the last year and is up to date with the latest version of
the draft.

## Maintainer Diversity

As before, the project is maintained by a single maintainer.
It's expected to have a single maintainer for the next year as well.

## Project Adoption

The primary objective of the project is to deliver a reference implementation for the SD-JWT draft. 
This project is intended solely for experimental purposes.

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals

The project successfully achieved its initial goal, but it was not widely adopted, and the original program was only partially completed

### Next Year's Goals

As before, the main goal of the project is to provide a reference implementation
for the SD-JWT draft. The project will continue to track the development of the
draft, including a potential transition to an RFC. The project will also continue
to exist as a reference for SD-JWT implementations.

## Help Required

The project is maintainable with one maintainer and no further aid is needed.
We are planning to automate the process (maybe using github actions).

## Project Lifecycle Stage Recommendation

The project is recommended to remain in the Labs stage.
