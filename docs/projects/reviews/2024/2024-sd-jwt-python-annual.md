# 2024 sd-jwt-python (SD-JWT Reference Implementation)

## Project Health

The main focus of this project is to provide a reference implementation for the
IETF SD-JWT draft. As such, the code has reflected the developments in the
specification over the last year and is up to date with the latest version of
the draft. Since the draft is approaching a stable state (and hopefully a final
RFC soon-ish), no drastic changes are expected in the codebase.


## Maintainer Diversity

As before, the project is maintained by a single maintainer, an editor of the
SD-JWT draft. Two developers have contributed code, one editor of the draft and
one external contributor.

## Project Adoption

The main task of the project is to provide a reference implementation for the
SD-JWT draft. The project is in use

 * by the editors of the draft to test new developments and to produce examples for the specification, 
 * by external contributors to understand testdrive SD-JWT, and
 * as a reference for testing and validation of other implementations.

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals

The project has met its goals for the last year, which were to keep the codebase
up to date with the latest version of the draft and to provide a reference
implementation for the draft.

### Next Year's Goals

As before, the main goal of the project is to provide a reference implementation
for the SD-JWT draft. The project will continue to track the development of the
draft, including a potential transition to an RFC. The project will also continue
to exist as a reference for SD-JWT implementations.

## Help Required

The project is in good shape and does not require any help at the moment.

## Project Lifecycle Stage Recommendation

The project is recommended to remain in the Labs stage.
