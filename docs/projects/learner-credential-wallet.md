## Project Description

The Learner Credential Wallet is a cross-platform iOS and Android mobile application for storing and sharing digital credentials, starting with higher learning.

The wallet is based on the [learner credential wallet specification](https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/docs/Learner-Credential-Wallet-Specification-May-2021.pdf) developed by the [Digital Credentials Consortium](https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/).

The app works with iOS and Android and allows users to add and share credentials, as well as manage the wallet.

Whenver possible, we use existing open standards from W3C, IETF, and other open standards groups.
