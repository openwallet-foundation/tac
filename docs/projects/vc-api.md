# VC API

## Project Description

The VC API is specification for a set of APIs for VC lifecycle management (https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/). This includes operations such as credential issuance, verification, and exchange. It is a W3C CCG work item and, as of the submission of this proposal, it is in “draft community report” status. 

The VC API’s design is informed by use cases across a range of domains. Several of these use cases are collected in a working group note (https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api-use-cases/). 

This project is an implementation of the VC API. The implementation aims to enable organizations and individuals to effortlessly conduct SSI operations over HTTP without requiring technical expertise, making it seamless to integrate into existing projects.
