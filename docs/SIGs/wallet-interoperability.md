# Wallet Interoperability Special Interest Group (WISIG)

The WISIG will focus on defining, publishing, and testing wallet interoperability profiles (WIPs). The WISIG will define how to create wallet interoperability profiles, and create WIPs for different wallet technical stacks, ensuring that digital wallets implementations adhere to the global standards referenced in the profile and can interact seamlessly with one another. The group will start by taking over maintenance of the existing AIP 2.0 profile, and create additional, parallel Wallet Interoperability Profiles that cover other technical stacks, such as OpenID4VCs, mDL/mDocs and so on. The group will also develop tools and guidance for testing the profiles to enable demonstrations of compliance and interoperability, leveraging existing test suites where available, and developing new test suites as needed.

This SIG was accepted by the TAC on [October 2, 2024](../meetings/2024/2024-10-02.md). See [Wallet Interoperability SIG Proposal](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/tac/issues/182) for more details.
