# Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

A _special interest group (SIG)_ under the Technical Advisory Council (TAC) is a group with a shared interest in advancing a specific area of knowledge, learning, or technology related to the mission of the OpenWallet Foundation where members cooperate to affect or to produce solutions within their particular field. Unlike a [task force](../task-forces/index.md), SIGs are typically long running and may or may not produce any deliverables. A SIG can be created by anyone in the OpenWallet Foundation community and must be proposed to and approved by the TAC.
