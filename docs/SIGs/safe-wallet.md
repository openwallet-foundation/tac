# Safe Wallet Special Interest Group (SIG)

This SIG will create, distribute and promote a set of material that will become the de-facto way to determine how "safe" the new breed of digital wallets is, and be able to compare them effectively. This will increase the visibility of the solutions to correlation and profiling issues that could be introduced with digital wallet deployments.

This SIG was accepted by the TAC on [September 20, 2023](../meetings/2023/2023-09-20.md). See [Safe Wallet SIG Proposal](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/tac/issues/57) for more details.
