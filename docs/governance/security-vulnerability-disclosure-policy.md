[//]: # (SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0)

This is a template for a security vulnerability disclosure policy for
OpenWallet Foundation (OWF) projects or subprojects within individual OWF projects
(we note that some projects may have different repositories with different
security policies). Please edit this as appropriate for your project and
delete this top section. For most projects, this will only involve minor
edits (look for {==HIGHLIGHTED==} text). For projects that have security experts,
feel free to edit and tailor to your project’s needs, but be sure that you
know what you’re doing. We expect this document to be linked from
`SECURITY.md` in your project's repositories.

If your project has multiple repositories then add the policy
in the primary repository of your project. Remaining repositories
can add a link to the primay repository's `SECURITY.md` file.

# What is a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy?

No piece of software is perfect. All software (at least, all software of a
certain size and complexity) has bugs. In open source development, members of
the community or the public find bugs and report them to the project. A
vulnerability disclosure policy explains how this process functions from the
perspective of the project.

This vulnerability disclosure policy explains the rules and guidelines for the
{==INSERT PROJECT NAME HERE==} project. It is intended to act as both a reference for outsiders –- including
both bug reporters and those looking for information on the project’s security
practices -- as well as a set of rules that maintainers and contributors have
agreed to follow.

# Vulnerability Disclosure Process and Associated Rules

All OpenWallet Foundation (OWF) projects, including this project, follow the associated process
and rules for vulnerability disclosures. We note that this outline is derived
from the [OpenSSF maintainers guide](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/maintainer-guide.md).

Each project will have a security team (see [people infrastructure](#people-infrastructure)). The security team
will be comprised of maintainers or contributors to the project who are
knowledgeable about security and is responsible for responding to and
helping to fix security vulnerabilities.

The security team (see [people infrastructure](#people-infrastructure)) for this project will do the
following for each reported vulnerability:
1. Acknowledge receipt (see [Report Intakes](#report-intakes)) of the
issue to the reporter within 2 business days.
2. Assess the issue. Engage with the reporter to ask any outstanding questions
about the report and how to reproduce it. If the report is not considered a
vulnerability, then the reporter should be informed and this process can be
halted. If the report is still a regular bug (just not a security
vulnerability), the reporter should be informed (if necessary) of the regular
process for reporting bugs, available {==INSERT WHERE YOUR PROJECT HAS REGULAR BUG REPORTS==}.
3. Some issues may require more time and resources to correct. If this
particular report is more complex, discuss an embargo period with the reporter.
The embargo period should be negotiated with the reporter and must not be
longer than 90 days.
4. Create a patch for the issue (see [Private Patch Deployment
Infrastructure](#private-patch-deployment-infrastructure)).
5. Request a CVE for the issue (see [CNA/CVE Reporting](#cnacve-reporting)).
6. Decide the date of public release.
7. If applicable, notify members of the embargo list of the upcoming patch
and release, as described above.
8. Cut a new (software) release in which the bug is fixed..
9. Publicly disclose the issue within 48 hours after the release. It is
recommended that this is done through GitHub security advisories (see
[(GitHub) Security Advisories](#github-security-advisories)).

# “People” Infrastructure

This section details the required basic vulnerability disclosure infrastructure
for the {==INSERT PROJECT NAME HERE==} project. There are quite a few necessary pieces of infrastructure,
so we go through them in detail here.

## Security Team
The {==INSERT PROJECT NAME HERE==} project must have a security response team of at
least three maintainers. This response team shall be set up BEFORE incidents
happen so that people know who to contact and how to contact them when an
emergency issue arises. It can be difficult to track down someone with unique
knowledge (e.g. in a particular area of cryptography) who is capable of
fixing a problem in a short period of time.
1. Each security team member will be a member of the
[OpenWallet Foundation security email list](mailto:security@lists.openwallet.foundation),
and, in general, any OWF-wide security infrastructure.
2. If a project has specialized code related to certain aspects of security
or cryptography (e.g. cryptographic algorithms), then
a corresponding specialist should be on the response team (e.g. someone
knowledgeable in cryptography). If a specialist
is not on the team, then the individual who is responsible for contacting or
engaging the specialists should be designated in their stead. We emphasize
that projects should have access to specialists in an area for which they
maintain code while recognizing that it may not be practical for these experts
to be on the response team.

The current response team maintainers are as follows:

| Name | Email ID | Chat ID | Area/Specialty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {==INSERT NAME==} | {==INSERT EMAIL==} | {==INSERT CHAT ID==} | {==INSERT AREA OF SPECIALTY==} |
| {==INSERT NAME==} | {==INSERT EMAIL==} | {==INSERT CHAT ID==} | {==INSERT AREA OF SPECIALTY==} |
| {==INSERT NAME==} | {==INSERT EMAIL==} | {==INSERT CHAT ID==} | {==INSERT AREA OF SPECIALTY==} |

## Discussion Forum

1. Projects may set up private discussion forums for approved maintainers and
security team participants to discuss vulnerabilities.
    1. The project uses the following private discussion forums for approved
    maintainers and security team participants, which may include Discord or
    email lists:
        1. {==INSERT PRIVATE DISCUSSION FORUM MECHANISM==}
        2. {==INSERT PRIVATE DISCUSSION FORUM MECHANISM==}

NOTE: Forums may be private but the existence of a forum must be public.

# Report Intakes
While all OWF projects are required to respond to security
vulnerability disclosures sent to the OWF security list
[security@lists.openwallet.foundation](mailto:security@lists.openwallet.foundation),
many projects have other authorized ways that reports are taken in as well.

This project has the following recommended ways to submit security
vulnerabilities. While the security team members will do their best to
respond to bugs disclosed in all possible ways, it is encouraged for bug
finders to report through the following approved channels:

- The [OWF security list](mailto:security@lists.openwallet.foundation):
To report a security issue, please send an email with the name of the project,
a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected
versions, and if known, mitigations for the issue.  Note that this is a
mandatory response channel.  We encourage reporters to default to this channel
for reporting vulnerabilities if there is no compelling reason to use other
channels.
to learn more about security infrastructure available in GitHub.
- {==INSERT ONE OF THE FOLLOWING==}
    - [GitHub security vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability): See also [GitHub Security Advisories](#github-security-advisories)
    - This project does not use GitHub for reporting because ...==}
- {==INSERT OTHER INTAKE==}: {==INSERT OTHER PROCESS==}

# CNA/CVE Reporting

All OWF [`Impact` stage](./project-lifecycle.md#impact-stage) projects are responsible for maintaining
a list of **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**. This should also be done
by projects in [`Growth` stage](./project-lifecycle.md#growth-stage).  For that reason, a project must designate a **CVE
numbering authority (CNA)** or set of authorities that the project uses to issue
CVEs.

It is recommended but not required that projects use GitHub as a CNA since the
reporting process here can be streamlined with the entire
[GitHub security advisory](#github-security-advisories) process.
It is also considered reasonable to have bug
bounty programs that can serve as CNAs such as Hackerone.

This project uses the following CNA(s) in the following situations:
1. {==INSERT CNA MECHANISM NAME==}:  {==INSERT WHEN THIS MECHANISM IS USED OR DEFAULT IF ONLY ONE CNA MECHANISM==}
1. {==INSERT CNA MECHANISM NAME==}:  {==INSERT WHEN THIS MECHANISM IS USED==}

# Embargo List

The OWF recommends that [`Impact` stage](./project-lifecycle.md#impact-stage) projects maintain an
embargo list. An embargo list is a list of known, trusted entities that run
large deployments of a project (of course, {==INSERT PROJECT NAME HERE==} project in our case). These
entities are notified ahead of time when important security patches are
incoming to minimize potential security risks to large deployments of this
project.

Parties are on this list primarily for one of two reasons, which are either
because they can either help fix the problem (perhaps through testing a fix at
scale) or they need extra time to help prepare their ecosystem to roll out
fixes quickly. Approval is not given lightly: project leadership
(maintainers) must be convinced that institutions on the list **“need to know"**
about issues in advance.

Participation in an embargo list should not be taken lightly. List members
are expected to respect the materials shared through it and not disclose any
information to unauthorized parties until the public disclosure date.
Institutions are on this list because their presence helps the project and its
users; if their actions do not help the project and its users, they can expect
to be removed from the list.

The {==INSERT PROJECT NAME HERE==} project team will publish guidelines for participation in the
embargo list. Alternatively, send an email to [OWF security
mailing list](mailto:security@lists.openwallet.foundation) with the reason for
you to be part of the embargo list.

{==INSERT THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IF THE PROJECT DOES NOT MAINTAIN AN EMBARGO LIST (UPDATE REASON AS NECESSARY)==}
This project does not maintain an embargo list. This is because we are too
small or there are no known large users of this project (if you are one, let us
know), and may change if people start using our software in production.

{==INSERT THE FOLLOWING TWO PARAGRAPHS IF THE PROJECT DOES MAINTAIN AN EMBARGO LIST==}
This project maintains a embargo list.  The security team listed above is
responsible for maintaining the embargo list.  Members of the security team
will send notifications of security issues to the embargo list using the
[OpenSSF embargo format](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/templates/notifications/embargo.md).

The list itself is private in order to make it slightly more difficult for
attackers with vulnerabilities to find systems to attack. Entities may be
added to the embargo list by a majority vote of the project's security response
team and should request to join the embargo list by contacting one or more of
the members of the security response team. If there is an issue about embargo
list membership where an entity feels like they are being dealt with unfairly
by the security response team, then they are encouraged to bring up the issue
in front of the OWF TAC, who can act as moderators.

# (GitHub) Security Advisories

It is highly recommended that OWF projects use [GitHub
security advisories and the GitHub security process](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories) for
handling security vulnerabilities. In particular, this is strongly recommended
for projects that do not have a large number of security experts as the
features serve as a nice set of **guardrails** to help make sure that things are
done correctly.

This project {==INSERT WHETHER THE PROJECT `does` OR `does not` (USE GITHUB SECURITY ADVISORIES)==} use GitHub security advisories.
{==INSERT WHAT FEATURES (IF ANY) ARE USED HERE IF THE WHOLE PACKAGE IS NOT UTILIZED==}

{==INSERT HOW SECURITY ISSUES ARE PUBLICLY DISCLOSED IF THE PROJECT DOES NOT USE gIThUB SECURITY ADVISORIES==}

## Private Patch Deployment Infrastructure

It is highly recommended by the OWF that [`Impact` stage](./project-lifecycle.md#impact-stage) projects
run private patch deployment infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. In
other words, patches that fix security vulnerabilities (potentially of some
severity) are built without public visibility.

OWF also recommends that projects use the private development features
of GitHub for private patch deployment infrastructure. For projects that wish
to set this up, we encourage contacting the community architects (the email is
community-architects@openwallet.foundation).

{==INSERT THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IF THE PROJECT DOES NOT UTILIZE ANY PRIVATE PATCH DEPLOYMENT INFRASTRUCTURE (UPDATE REASON IF NECESSARY)==}
This project does not utilize any private patch deployment infrastructure.
This is because we are too small or we want to advertise our security flaws in
advance, and may change if people start using our software in production.

{==INSERT THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IF THE PROJECT DOES UTILIZE PRIVATE PATCH DEPLOYMENT INFRASTRUCTURE==}
This project builds patches addressing security vulnerabilities in a private
way. In particular, the following infrastructure is used:

{==INSERT THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IF THE PROJECT USES GITHUB==}
This project uses the private development features of GitHub for security
vulnerabilities. GitHub has [extensive documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories)
of these features.

{==INSERT THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IF THE PROJECT DOES NOT USE GITHUB==}
This project uses the following private development features: {==INSERT MECHANISM THAT YOU USE==}.
