<p style="text-align: center;">Effective May 22, 2023</p>

1. **Mission and Scope of the OpenWallet Foundation.**

    The purpose of the OpenWallet Foundation (the “OWF”) is to support various open source, open data and/or other open projects relating to or supporting development of digital wallets, including infrastructure and support initiatives related thereto (each such project, a “Technical Project”) , in accordance with the provisions of this Charter. The governance of each Technical Project is as set forth in the charter for that Technical Project.

    The OWF aims to enable entities to transact securely, and in a privacy enhancing fashion, in- person and on-line where attributes stored in, and managed by, the wallet. The OWF will:

    * develop and maintain open source code for wallets to enable and ensure wallet interoperability,
    * advocate for the adoption of the interoperable digital wallet technology, and
    * collaborate with Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) in the development and proliferation of open standards related to digital wallets

    The OWF will not publish a publicly available wallet (including into any application stores).

    The OWF supports the Technical Projects. The OWF operates under the guidance of the Governing Board of the OWF (the “Governing Board”) and Linux Foundation Europe (the “LFEU”) as may be consistent with Linux Foundation Europe’s tax-exempt status.

    The Governing Board manages the OWF. The Governing Board may establish other committees and other working groups (collectively, and including the Technical Advisory Council, “Committees”) which will report to the Governing Board.

2. **Sponsorship.**
      1. The OWF will be composed of Premier, General and Associate Sponsors (each, a “Sponsor” and, collectively, the “Sponsors”) in Good Standing. All Sponsors must be current Sponsors of LFEU (at any level) to participate in the OWF as a Sponsor. All sponsors in the OWF, enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations described in this Charter, as from time-to-time amended by the Governing Board, with the approval of LFEU. During the term of their sponsorship, all Participants will comply with all such policies as the LFEU Board of Directors and/or the OWF may adopt with notice to Sponsors.
      1. Premier Sponsors will be entitled to appoint a representative to the Governing Board and any Committee.
      1. General Sponsors, acting as a class, will be entitled to annually elect one representative to the Governing Board for every ten General Sponsors, up to a maximum of three total representatives, provided that there will always be at least one General Sponsor representative, even if there are less than ten General Sponsors. The Governing Board determines the General Sponsor representative election process.
      1. The Associate Sponsor category of sponsorship is limited to Associate Sponsors of LFEU. The Governing Board may set additional criteria for sponsoring the OWF as an Associate Sponsor. If the Associate Sponsor is itself a membership or participation organization, Associate Sponsorship in the OWF does not confer any privileges or rights to the members or participants of the Associate Sponsor.
      1. Sponsors will be entitled to:
          1. participate in OWF general meetings, initiatives, events and any other activities; and
          1. identify themselves as sponsors of the OWF supporting the OWF community.
1. **Governing Board**
      1. The Governing Board voting members will consist of:
          1. one representative appointed by each Premier Sponsor;
          1. the TAC Representative (as defined below), or, in the absence of a chair and with the approval of the Governing Board, any active contributor to a Technical Project so designated by the TAC (such chair or designee the “TAC Representative”); and
          1. the elected General Sponsor representative or representatives.

      1. The Governing Board will also include nonvoting members consisting of the GAC Representative (defined in Section 4) and Associate Representative.

          1. The Associate Representative will be chosen based on their efforts and potential to advance the OWF mission. The Associate Representative will be selected by the Governing Board voting representatives through a process determined by the Governing Board.

      1. Only one Sponsor that is part of a group of Related Companies (as defined in Section 7) may appoint, or nominate for a sponsorship class election, a representative on the Governing Board. No single Sponsor, company or set of Related Companies will be entitled to: (i) appoint or nominate for sponsorship class election more than one representative for the Governing Board, or (ii) have more than two representatives on the Governing Board.

          1. The only path to two representatives from the same group of Related Companies that will be acceptable will be for one Sponsor to appoint or nominate a representative to the Governing Board and have another of its employees, or an employee of one of its Related Companies, serve as the TAC Representative on the Governing Board.

          1. “Related Companies” are entities that are each a Related Company of a Sponsor.

      1. Only the legal entity which has executed a Project Sponsorship Agreement and its Subsidiaries will be entitled to enjoy the rights and privileges of such sponsorship; provided, however, that such Sponsor and its Subsidiaries will be treated together as a single Sponsor.
