# Task Force

A _task force_ is a group that is focused on a task with limited scope and fixed time to complete. A task force can be created by anyone in the OpenWallet Foundation community and must be proposed to and approved by the TAC.

## Propose a Task Force
To propose a task force, create an issue in [the TAC GitHub repository](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/tac/issues). The issue should be named "Task Force Proposal: _\<name of task force\>_". The issue should include the following information:

* Introduction/background material
* Objectives of the task force
* List of deliverables or work products
* Time to complete (_no more than 6 months_)
* Leader(s)
* Initial participant list

## Approval Process
The TAC will review the task force proposal first by providing comments in the issue and secondly by bringing the task force proposal to a discussion and vote in a TAC meeting.

The decision of the vote will be documented in the issue. If the task force is approved, a discussion channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/yjvGPd5FCU) will be created. In addition, we will work with the OpenWallet Foundation program management to schedule a meeting on the [OpenWallet Foundation calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y181MjdhMWRiNjIxZmU3MDczMzg0MjFhOWM0YzdlZjJmNjE2MGI5NzM4MzhjZmRiYjUwZjBkYjMyYWQwZmQyMGViQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20). If necessary, a GitHub repository will also be created at the request of the task force leader(s).

## Reporting on Task Force Completion of Deliverables
Upon completion of the task force's deliverables, the task force should arrange a time with the TAC chair to present the deliverables at a TAC meeting. This can be accomplished by sending an email to [the TAC mailing list](https://lists.openwallet.foundation/g/tac) at  [tac@lists.openwallet.foundation](mailto:tac@lists.openwallet.foundation).

## Requesting an Extension on Completion Date
If the task force is not able to complete the deliverables by the specified completion date, then the leader of the task force should arrange a time with the TAC chair to discuss the extension at a TAC meeting. This discussion should include information on the current status, the delays, and the expected updates to the schedule. This can be accomplished by sending an email to [the TAC mailing list](https://lists.openwallet.foundation/g/tac) at [tac@lists.openwallet.foundation](mailto:tac@lists.openwallet.foundation).
