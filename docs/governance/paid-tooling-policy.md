# Paid Tooling Policy

Project and Lab Services - Open Wallet Foundation

Open Wallet provides a number of paid developer tools and services for projects. Below, we list all of the ones that our projects currently use. We have divided them up by tiers, which indicate the level of support (and the timeframe of support) that projects can expect from the HLF staff. We emphasize that just because a tool or service is not on this list does not mean projects cannot use it; it just means that they will have to (mostly) support it themselves.

Our tool list is as follows:

Recommended Tools

In order to help projects that may be looking to get started with using tooling/services, we offer the following general recommendations. They don't necessarily work for every project, but they should be optimal for most projects.

-   Technical Documentation: use markdown, GitHub pages, and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

-   Informal documentation and details (e.g. meeting notes, meeting agendas, long-term planning documentation, etc.): use GitHub

-   CI: use GitHub Actions.

-   Artifact Storage: Use GitHub packages.

-   Communication: Use Discord, unless it is blocked in your country.

-   Bug tracking: Use GitHub Issues and GitHub Projects.

-   Mailing lists: Groups.io

Finally we emphasize that this list does not cover security-related tools or services.
