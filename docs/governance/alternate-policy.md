# TAC Alternate Policy

A TAC voting member may designate an alternate for a specific meeting, and must notify the chair in advance of the meeting. The TAC voting member is responsible for ensuring that the named alternate has enough information to represent the TAC voting member in all matters that will be covered in the meeting. The named alternate will participate in any votes that occur during the meeting for which they were named an alternate, and their vote will count as if it were cast by the TAC voting member.

!!! warning
    If a TAC voting member regularly names an alternate and

       - is a TAC Premier Sponsor Representative, then that TAC voting member should consider whether they should replace themselves with the alternate, or
       - is a TAC "At Large" Representative, then that TAC voting member should consider whether they should resign.
