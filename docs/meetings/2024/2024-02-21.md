- [Bifold Project Proposal](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/project-proposals/pull/29)
   - RESOLVED: That the Bifold project proposal is hereby confirmed, approved, and adopted as a growth project.
     - Wenjing volunteered to be second sponsor for the project
     - Jeremie motion; Wenjing seconded; Unanimously approved

- Project Promotion Process
    - Our current project lifecycle does not clearly outline the steps necessary for projects to progress in the lifecycle.
    - Suggested changes to the lifecycle to create a PR to update the original project proposal to include the new stage and other information relevant to meet the proposed stage’s criteria.
    - Upside: This process is similar to the original project proposal process.
    - Possible Downside: This will overwrite the original proposal but might not be a concern given the history in GitHub on the file.
    - If we do a PR to the original proposal, we will need to make sure that we can have links to the previous versions that were approved.
    - We can possibly do this via the project pages by adding a new section
    - Action: Tracy to create a PR to provide details on what this will look like.

- Open discussion and next steps
