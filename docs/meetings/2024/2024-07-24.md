        The document emphasizes four fundamental Pillars for Safe Wallets:

        1. Privacy Pillar: Privacy by Design (PbD) is crucial for digital wallets, focusing on protecting user data from unwanted observation and tracking. The document outlines principles and mechanisms to ensure privacy, such as avoiding unique identifiers and decoupling issuers and verifiers
        1. Security Pillar: Security by Design and Zero Trust principles are essential for digital wallets. The document details various security measures, including key management, credential management, and secure presentation protocols to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity
        1. Supporting Functions: Supporting functions for digital wallets include mechanisms for wallet and device locking/unlocking, user interface/user experience considerations, and holder binding. The document emphasizes the importance of these functions for ensuring security and usability
        1. Governance Pillar: Governance involves regulatory compliance, certification, counterparty verification, and audit requirements. The document discusses the need for digital wallets to adhere to legal standards and provide mechanisms for accountability and transparency
