- Project Proposals: 
    - [ACA-Py Minimal Example](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/project-proposals/pull/59)
        - A lightweight starter kit for ACA-Py developers by OWF contributors
        - **Focus**: AME is a tool for creating a minimal reproducible instance of ACA-Py, allowing users to quickly reproduce a bug or demo a feature with a simple script. It contains a hackable controller able to interact with an ACA-Py instance, and some pre-defined protocols that cause two ACA-Py instances to interact
        - **Feedback**:
            - Stephen C. and Troy K. support the approach, request clear modularity and alignment with upstream
            - David A. suggested coordination with other ACA-Py adopters (e.g., FindyNet)
        - **Next Step**: A TAC vote will only occur if Athan's team decides to contribute the project as a standalone lab. If it is added directly to the ACA-Py project, no vote is needed. Athan will consult with Indicio and report back. Sean to follow up.
    - **RESOLVED:** [EUDIPLO Wallet](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/project-proposals/pull/60)
        - A lightweight, open-source **middleware layer** designed to simplify integration with the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet) ecosystem. Presented as a candidate OWF project to ensure transparency and interoperability across jurisdictions
        - **Feedback**:
            - Proposal needs clearer documentation and clarification of licensing and upstream alignment. Mirko clarified that the project uses the Apache 2.0 license and all dependencies are compliant
            - Stefan Kauhaus asked about its comparison to the EU Commission's reference implementation, which Mirko addressed, stating it would work perfectly with it once standards are final. 
        - **Approved unanimously by 6 out of 7 TAC voting members present (Stavros absent).**
        - **Next Step**: Sean will coordinate the onboarding process, including project formation documents and repository transfer.

- TAC Elections
    - The TAC election process remains open, with two seats unfilled.
    - Due to a delay, the nomination call will be relaunched and the relevant GitHub pages will be updated this week.
    - A reminder will be sent to all TAC members with nomination links and a proposed voting timeline.
